## [Unreleased]

### Platform foundation

- Laravel 13 app on the official React starter kit (Inertia 3, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind 4, shadcn/ui),
  Fortify auth (2FA, passkeys), Wayfinder, Pest 5, Larastan level 7, Laravel Boost AI guidelines & skills.
- Modular monolith: auto-discovered `app/Modules/*` with conventions for config, migrations, routes, views,
  commands and scheduled tasks; `MODULES=` filter for isolated test runs (ADR 0001).
- Shared kernel: `Money` (minor units, ADR 0002), `BillingCycle`, `BillableType`, cross-module contracts
  (`Invoicer`, `TaxCalculator`, `CreditLedger`, `PriceBook`, `ServiceRegistry`, `DomainRegistry`,
  `DomainPricing`, `MergeFieldRegistry`), DTOs and 37 domain events.
- Server-driven sidebar navigation and dashboard-card registries; admin (`/admin`) and client (`/client`) areas.
- Object storage: `objects` disk backed by RustFS via `compose.yaml` + `objects:ensure-bucket` command (ADR 0004).

### Core

- Clients, client groups, contacts, multi-user client accounts (owner + per-area permissions), staff flag,
  roles with wildcard permissions, currencies, settings store, activity log.
- Admin: client list/search/filter, create, view, edit. Client area: dashboard, account details, account switcher.
- Registration creates an owned client account.
- Seeders: currencies (USD/EUR/GBP), roles, `admin@example.com` / `demo@example.com` (password: `password`).

### Domains

- TLD catalog with per-term register/transfer/renew prices per currency and client-group slab (no silent currency
  conversion), grace/redemption periods and fees, renew windows, EPP requirement and registrar assignment.
- `DomainPricing` (`price`, `terms`, `split` for multi-level TLDs such as `.co.uk`, renewal terms within the
  10-year registry horizon) and `DomainRegistry` (`createPending`, `process`, `cancelPending`) implementations.
- Domain lifecycle state machine (pending → active → grace → redemption → expired, transfers, cancellations) with
  activity log and events; IDN/punycode-safe name normalisation and validation; one live record per name.
- Registrar driver contract, driver registry and deterministic `log` demo registrar; every call goes through a
  gateway that checks capabilities and writes a redacted `registrar_command_log`.
- Queued register/transfer/renew jobs with retries; timeouts never re-register; renewals are never repeated.
- Automation: renewal invoicing (idempotent per cycle), grace/redemption invoice swap and expiry cancellation,
  ICANN-style reminders with per-client digest, registrar and transfer sync (hourly `domains:sync`), log pruning.
- Admin: domain list (status/registrar/TLD/expiry/client filters) and detail (dates, amounts, forced status,
  registrar commands, nameservers, lock, EPP, contacts, command log, move, delete), TLD pricing grid, registrars.
- Client area: my domains, domain management (nameservers, auto-renew, lock, EPP code, contacts, transfer retry).
- Public domain search with availability, suggestions and prices; JSON lookup endpoint (rate limited, cached).
- Navigation, dashboard cards, permissions, settings, global search and `domain` merge fields; demo seeder.
